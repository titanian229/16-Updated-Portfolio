# Personal Page and Portfolio

This is the repo for my updated personal web page, created to show information about me and a brief summary of some of my projects.  This version can be found at https://titanian229.github.io/16-Updated-Portfolio/ .
It is mobile first, designed to adjust the viewing experience dependent on viewport size.

The page loads with an initial full page image, including several isolated elements that are animated.  A sidebar menu allows for navigation to each section.
